        <p>I grew up as a shy and quiet type of kid. I was always the one who kept to myself and 
            kept my thoughts and feelings to myself. I was never type to be the center of attention 
            or the one who was always in the background, never wanting to be noticed. I was never 
            the most popular kid in school, but I was never the one who was picked on either. I just 
            kept to myself, did my own thing and stayed out of any drama or conflict. I think that 
            this was one of the best decisions I ever made, because it kept me out of trouble and 
            allowed me to focus on my studies.</p>
