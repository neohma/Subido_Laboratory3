        <p>With all honesty, I’ve been struggling to find the exact words to describe how I am as a human being living in this world.
            Up to now, I find it extremely difficult whenever I am asked, “Who are you?” “Can you describe yourself?”           
            Except for knowing my name,this is a little information that I know about myself. I’m an introverted person.            
            Some of my relatives told me that I am a boring person which is not to me. I prefer to be alone than to socialize.            
            My hobby is reading—fiction books, not educational ones. I enjoy studying too, though I’m not the smartest, but I am very studious.            
            I am the student who passed the activity early. I am not a “Due Tomorrow Do Tomorrow” type of student. I value time and hate cramming.            
            I like both the sunset and moonlight. Though I wake up early, I prefer the calm of the night. As for food, I love spicy dishes.            
            To me, food without spice is just dull. I fear certain things, like slimy creatures and cockroaches, but I aim to overcome these fears.            
            And lastly, Privacy is very important to me.</p>
