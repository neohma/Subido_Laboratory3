                <p>I love immersing myself in fiction books, where I can escape and express my inner self. Reading has this incredible power to lift my mood and change how I feel instantly. It's almost like a portal to happiness and a way to unwind. In addition to reading, I sometimes write stories during my free moments or whenever I feel the urge to create. Writing isn't exactly my passion, but it allows me to express emotions that I may not otherwise share.</p>

                <img src="Assets/idol.png" alt="Music">
                <p>I'm a dedicated fan of various idols and music groups. Listening to their music uplifts me, filling me with inspiration and motivation, especially when it comes to my studies. It's a positive boost that also supports my mental health, offering comfort and encouragement when I need it most. Their songs seem to connect with me deeply, energizing my day.</p>

                <img src="Assets/watching.jpg" alt="Dramas">
                <p>When I'm not in the mood to read or if I just want to relax, I turn to films or series to pass the time. Recently, I've been drawn to Chinese dramas, which have a unique charm and storytelling style that I really enjoy. Watching these shows offers a pleasant escape, and it's my go-to when I want to unwind without much effort. It's a wonderful way to let go of stress and immerse myself in a new world.</p>

                <p>Writing and reading are essential for my emotional expression. They serve as my coping mechanisms, allowing me to process my thoughts and reflect on my experiences. Through writing, I can convey my imagination and connect with my inner world. Reading, on the other hand, helps me understand different perspectives and fuels my creativity. Together, they allow me to escape into various realms and express the complexities of my mind.</p>

                <img src="Assets/travel.jpg" alt="Travel">
                <p>I enjoy traveling, particularly when I join my auntâ€™s family on trips around Luzon. Exploring new places brings me a sense of adventure and allows me to experience different cultures and landscapes. These trips often open my eyes to the beauty of my surroundings and provide a break from routine. Traveling with my auntâ€™s family also strengthens our bond as we share new experiences together. It's an opportunity to create lasting memories while discovering hidden gems across the region.</p>

                <img src="Assets/sunmoon.jpg" alt="Meditation">
                <p>Sunset and moonlight meditation are two of my favorite ways to find peace and relaxation. Watching the sunset allows me to let go of the dayâ€™s stress and embrace a quiet moment of reflection. Sunsets symbolize closure and the transitions of life, offering a natural pause to rest and recharge. Similarly, moonlight meditation invites introspection and creativity, helping me connect with my deeper emotions. These moments of stillness under the sky are perfect for self-discovery and exploring the mysteries within.</p>

              <img src="Assets/littleme.jpeg" alt="About Me">
              <p>With all honesty, I've been struggling to find the exact words to describe how I am as a human being living in this world. Up to now, I find it extremely difficult whenever I am asked, "Who are you?" "Can you describe yourself?" Except for knowing that my name, this is a little information that I know about myself. I'm an introvert, this person. Some of my relatives told me that I am a boring person which is not meâ€”I prefer to be alone than to socialize. My hobby is reading fiction books, not educational ones. I enjoy studying, too, though I'm not the smartest but I am very studious. I am the student who passed the activity early. I am not a "Due Tomorrow Do Tomorrow" type of student. I value time and hate cramming. I like both the sunset and moonlight. Though I wake up early, I prefer the calm of the night. As for food, I love spicy dishes. To me, food without spice is just dull. I fear certain things, like slimy creatures and cockroaches, but I aim to overcome these fears. Lastly, Privacy is very important to me.</p>
